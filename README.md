Update: NOW SUPPORTS FIRST | SECOND | LAST BOSS For dungeons (Not all for now, cus im too lazy, i think only TR | RK | RR | AA)

 THE FINAL (MAYBE) IS HERE: (Screw double loading screens) :c
Changes your spawn location so you spawn closer to the boss. The following dungeon are supported, and the value on right is their default status. 

* Ghiliglade | On
* Pit of Pitrax | Off
* Broken Prison | Off
* Ruinous Manor (N/H) | Off
* Lilith's Keep (N/H) | Off
* Thaumetal Refinery (N/H) | Off
* RK-9 Kennel (N/H) | Off
* Red Refuge (N/H) | Off
* Antaroth's Abyss (N/N) | Off

To turn them on in game, type the following command: 
> /proxy ts dungeon_short_name boss_number

ex: /proxy ts rkn second
If no boss_number is provided, it will default to first boss.
Boss_number takes following argument : first | second | last

> Type : /proxy ts help [for the list of supported dungeons]

Once you turn it on, the module will change the status back to off after 5 minutes.

Typing the same command again will turn it off. 

Have fun, Don't abuse it. I am not responsible to w/e happens to your account!  
(ALSO I DIDN'T TEST ALL OF THE DUNGEONS, IF IT DOESN'T WORK, LET ME KNOW)
