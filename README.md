# Automatically uses Brooch and Rootbeer (if you have them) when using certain skills.  ***Auto detects the brooch you have***

There is two section
useBroochOn [Currently supports : Gamble, ARush, Dexter]
useRootBeerOn [Currently supports: Gamble, ARush, Rampage]

Put skills in respective field that you want to have auto use effect.

You can get skill ID's from https://moongourd.com/info or do /proxy au debug and use the skill, it will print on your console.
Commands: 
> /proxy au on

> /proxy au off

> /proxy debug

> /proxy help

I have no idea when other classes uses their stuff so, add it yourself in skills!
Note if you include multiple skill for same class, it will use brooch + beer on the first skill used where the items are off cooldown.
